.. Hello, my name is Vuthy! I am a Civil Engineer, specialized in river and geospatial engineering,  with industry experiences in piped-water supply design, hydrological modeling, GIS, Web GIS, mapping, geo-data/satellite image analysis, programming, classification and big data. I am currently an Engineer in River Department at Nippon Koei Co., Ltd based in head quarter in Tokyo, Japan, where I work on different kinds of data sorting tasks, satellite-image analysis and Deep Learning models to do semantic segmentation on satellite images. Besides that, I sometimes offer an online course on `Geospatial Data Analysis with Python <https://geospatialyst.github.io/homepage/course/>`__ to Cambodian graduated students and professionals.

.. I graduated a master of Civil Engineering degree from The University of Tokyo in Japan in 2020. I recieved solid training in flood simulation and damage assessment, programming languages, machine learning and deep learning. I am proficient in QGIS/ArcGIS/ArcGIS Pro, geospatial data analysis, LaTeX, Python and Geo-Python, data retrieval and processing in Google Earth Engine, data classification and extraction, and data visualization. I am particularly interested in working with satellite image data and dealing with large dataset. On the other hand, I like to spend time learning something new and explore more knowledge from various sources, and then write it down to my personal portfolio. Recently, I am really interested in learning and improving my knowledge in Web GIS development and interactive mapping using Mapbox and Leaflet.
