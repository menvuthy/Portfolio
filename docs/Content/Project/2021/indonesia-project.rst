   :caption: In this project, I conducted several analytic work and map development using high-resolution satellite image data of Northern Indonesia. It is the international project of the company I am working for; therefore, there are so many information I cannot disclose. However, what I present here is just the method I myself developed, so it can be used for learning. Nonetheless, the analysis includes area and shoreline extraction works for time-change comparison.
