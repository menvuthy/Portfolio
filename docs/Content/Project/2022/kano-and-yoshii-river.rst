Kano & Yoshii river: Land cover classification using machine learning
==========================================================================================

In this project, I try to develop supervised machine learning model in Python to classify the land cover type within the river channel. The model is developed by using the training data of 4 seasons satellite images at Kano and Yoshii river in Japan.
