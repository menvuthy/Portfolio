Landsat 9
=================================

---------

**Description**

This dataset contains atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and land surface temperature derived from the data produced by the Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS sensors. These images contain 5 visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands and 2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance, and one thermal infrared (TIR) band processed to orthorectified surface temperature. They also contain intermediate bands used in calculation of the ST products, as well as QA bands.

Landsat 9 SR products are created with the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC). All Collection 2 ST products are created with a single-channel algorithm jointly created by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
